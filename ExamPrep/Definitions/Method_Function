Method and function are both "small programs" that have parameters,
perform some operation and may return a value.

The main difference is that methods are functions tied to a particular object.

Functions should:
1) Do one thing also known as SRP (Single Responsible Principal)
2) Be Readable
3) Be Reusable
4) Be Complete
5) Not be too long
