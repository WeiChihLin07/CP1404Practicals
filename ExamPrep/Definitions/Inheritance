Inheritance gives us a way to organise code
1) Specialise : a subclass can inherit code from its superclass,
                but modify anything that is particular to that subclass.

2) Override: change super class behaviour to be specific to a subclass

3) Reuse: use code from super classes to get that behaviour in our class.
